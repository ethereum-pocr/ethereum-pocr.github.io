# Docker build

**requirements**
generate access token with api read rights (`read_api` scopde) and export into env variables `GITLAB_USER` and `GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN`.    
Use gitlab personal page to create the token: https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens.   
Your `GITLAB_USER` is the user without the `@` or alternatively the name of the token you created.

```sh
echo GITLAB_USER=your_gitlab_user >> $HOME/.bashrc 
echo GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_gitlab_password >> $HOME/.bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc
```

** Build monitoring.dockerfile
```sh
docker build -f monitoring.dockerfile -t pocr-mon . 
```

# docker-compose.yml content

In the root of the `pocr-monorepo` folder there is a `docker-compose.yml` that bootstrap many services 

 * geth-bootnode: Used as discovery node for the blockchain and the `Dockerfile` of the service can be found at `pocr-network/bootnode/Dockerfile`

 * sealer-1,2,3: Those are 3 nodes that start `geth` client with `Proof Of Carbon Reduction` and the `Dockerfile`can be found at `pocr-network/sealer/Dockerfile`
 The `Dockerfile` uses `multistage` the default stage `runtime` will download the `geth` built priviously and available in the gitlab and the second stage `dev` is to get `geth` from local machine
 To use `dev` stage update in `.env` file the key `SEALER_TARGET` by `dev` instead of `runtime` and then copy your `geth` binary to `pocr-network/sealer/geth`

 * pocr-monitoring: frontend app that will monitor the network (local or remote) nodes and show the carbon footprint of each and the `CTC` rewards cumulated by each

 * lite-explorer: An opensource solution, to explorer the blocks of the blockchain

 * monitor and dahsboard: An opensource solution to start the ethstats monitor on the network


**.env file** 
This file is used by `docker-compose.yml` to read the default environment variables

**pocr-network/genesis directory**
This directory contains some genesis files used as example to bootstrap the blockchain locally.
Example:
 * `pocr-network/genesis/saturndev-sealer1-authorized.json`: init the network with only `sealer-1` as authorized node to seal blocks in the network
 * `pocr-network/genesis/saturndev-all-sealers-authorized.json`: init the network with all the 3 sealers authorized

You can start the local network with any `genesis` file you want by changing in `.env` file the path to genesis `MOUNT_GENESIS_FILE_PATH=<path_to_genesis_file>` and the network id `NETWORK_ID=<network_id_of_the_genesis>`


# Start/stop the stack

in the root folder there are `start.sh` and `stop.sh` scripts to start and stop the stack.

Those scripts use `docker-compose.yml` to start all or some specific services

By default start.sh will only start portainer if no arguments are passed to the script
```sh
./start.sh
```

If you want to start all the services (network, monitoring and lb) use `all` as argument
```sh
./start.sh all 
```

If you want to start just the network use `network` as argument
```sh
./start.sh network
```

If you want to start just the monitoring use `monitoring` as argument
```sh
./start.sh monitoring
```

You can also combine arguments if needed, like starting `network`services and `monitoring` services
```sh
./start.sh network monitoring
```

If you want to run process in background add `-d` option to the start command, example:
```sh
# start monitoring in background
./start.sh monitoring -d

# start network in background
./start.sh network -d
```

To stop the stack use 
```sh
./stop.sh
```

And then open portainer in your browser http://localhost:9000
At first, initiate Portainer with a login password
You would then have the possibility to view your 3 nodes logs in real time directly in your browser, including possible monitoring services you would add in your network through the docker-compose.

Logs are refreshed auomatically. Your network will be correclty mining if you see the logs
