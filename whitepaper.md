# Proof of Carbon Reduction Whitepaper

2021 has seen an increase of the financial sector adoption of the public blockchains to host financial instruments and to operate their ownership trasnfer against cash instruments (CBDC, Stable coins ...).

Large institutions, public and private, in Europe and Asia mostly, are investing and are pushing their market to invest in the blockchain sector, considering that the blockchain technology can become progressively a substitute infrastructure for the financial market.

Indeed, public blockchains are an IT infrastructure run by parties with motivations independant of the infrastructure usage.   
This paper is not about discussing the history and background of blockchains, but let's just remind ourself that the main reason why nodes run consistently a consensus based infrastructure is because of their individual interest in earning a crypto currency they can sell to the highest bidder.

In this paper we evaluate a new consensus at the base of a new public blockchain to embed an incentive to improve the ecological impacts of the IT infrastructure.  

## 1. The problem to solve

## 2. The mechanic of incentivizing carbon footprint reduction 

## 3. Calculating the carbon footprint of a node

Cannot yet be automated and embeded in a consensus, hence required external parties, taking the form of oracle, to feed the info.


## 4. Deriving from the proof of authority consensus

The financial sector requirement for known sealers/miners

## 5. Calculating the reward of a node and the incentive scheme

## 6. Monetary policy of the CTC crypto currency

## 7. Implementing the consensus

Starting with the go version (why?)

## 8. Attack vectors and remediations


## 9. Opening to the community
