# Proof of Carbon Reduction Whitepaper

2021 has seen an increase of the financial sector adoption of the public blockchains to host financial instruments and to operate their ownership trasnfer against cash instruments (CBDC, Stable coins ...).

Large institutions, public and private, in Europe and Asia mostly, are investing and are pushing their market to invest in the blockchain sector, considering that the blockchain technology can become progressively a substitute infrastructure for the financial market.

Indeed, public blockchains are an IT infrastructure run by parties with motivations independant of the infrastructure usage.   
This paper is not about discussing the history and background of blockchains, but let's just remind ourself that the main reason why nodes run consistently a consensus based infrastructure is because of their individual interest in earning a crypto currency they can sell to the highest bidder.

In this paper we propose a new consensus at the base of a new public blockchain to embed an incentive to improve the ecological impacts of the IT infrastructure.  

## 1. The problem to solve

The human civilisation is in an era where the ecological impacts of its activities has become a growing concern and this concern is becoming a driving force for multiple policies. These policies are helping but they are often hindered by the additional financial investment that positive ecological impacts takes.   
Human nature is often driven by self interests that sometime coincide with the common interest but sometime it doesn't. And it appears that in the ecological situation the global interest is often not aligned with self interest.

In the sole scope of IT infrastructure, the demand for storage and computational power is increasing and these services requires energy, rare materials and often use hardware insufficiently recycled. If research and development exists in improving the ecological quality of the infrastructures it could be increased.

Blockchain technologies, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto with bitcoin, and improved by Vitalik Butterin with Ethereum, and many others since then, have exploited self interest of individual to create a greater good in the form of a shared IT distributed infrastructure used to securely transfer ownership of value and run computational and storage logic with no central authority. The self interest leveraged by this type technology is the earning of a new form of asset (called crypto currencies) that obtain a monetary value when sold to those who need to use the IT infrastructure it powers.

This paper will not document, not explain, the fundamentals of a public blockchain and the readers are directed to the 2 most relevant whitepapers for [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/)

## 2. The mechanic of incentivizing carbon footprint reduction 

## 3. Calculating the carbon footprint of a node

Cannot yet be automated and embeded in a consensus, hence required external parties, taking the form of oracle, to feed the info.


## 4. Deriving from the proof of authority consensus

The financial sector requirement for known sealers/miners

## 5. Calculating the reward of a node and the incentive scheme (Tokenomics)

## 6. Monetary policy of the CTC crypto currency

## 7. Implementing the consensus

Starting with the go version (why?)

## 8. Attack vectors and remediations


## 9. Opening to the community
